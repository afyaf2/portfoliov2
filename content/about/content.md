My route to getting stuck in to web development hasn’t been a traditional one, but it certainly makes for a great story.

I’ve lived in 5 cities, across 3 continents, and worked with people from Oakland to Osaka. I’ve briefed Japanese businessmen and managed relationships with influencers and club owners - but that was all in the past.

In 2017 I quit my job in Taipei, went full force in to enhancing my understanding of the digital world. In early 2018 I attended the #1 Coding Bootcamp in the world - Le Wagon. Since then I’ve built numerous sites for friends and clients alike.

These days I stay occupied by keeping up with web design trends, expanding my understanding of React, fooling around with GraphQl and keeping my knowledge of Rails&nbsp;fresh.

I love helping people that want to execute take their vision online. I have experience with e-commerce, state-of-the-art marketing sites and landing pages that will blow your prospects away.
