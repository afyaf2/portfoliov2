## Time to develop
### Leave this to me.

* This is my bread and butter. I’ll handle it from here.

* Once the design is done, it’s time to start development. I’ll give you constant progress updates and keep you in the loop.

* You’re now just weeks away from seeing all of your work come together. Sit back, relax and start planning your social media strategy!

* My keyboard is about to get a workout.
