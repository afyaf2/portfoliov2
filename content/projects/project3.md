Instant live chat app designed to mimick the UX of Slack. Using the Chatkit API, the app is hosted on a nodeJS/Express backend with a React frontend. Semantic UI was used to style the UI. The user can interact with other users, create a new room, and see when other users are typing in the same room. Hosted on Heroku.
